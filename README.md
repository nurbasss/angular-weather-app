# About project
Live Demo https://frosty-wilson-be7752.netlify.app/
This app shows current weather in place user entered acording to OpenWeatherMap API. 
Also I made some manipulations to show forecast for next weekdays, because weatherAPI provides forecast request for payment. But I complete it with another type of request.
During project I tried all my best in data binding and learn pipes in Angular and also practice RxJs.
